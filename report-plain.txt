Tangub Shopeasy - Brief (Plain Language)

What it is:
- An online marketplace for Tangub City where customers shop, vendors manage their store, and admins oversee everything.

Who uses it:
- Customers: browse shops and products, order, rate (1–3 stars), message vendors, see order updates.
- Vendors: add products, see sales and order charts, change order status, message customers, edit store details.
- Admins: approve vendors, view users/vendors/orders, download reports, and keep deleted records in an archive.

How it’s built:
- Uses web tech (React + TypeScript) for the app.
- Supabase provides the database, logins, file storage for images, and live updates (so order status changes show immediately).

Key safety checks:
- Different logins for customers and vendors; unapproved vendors can’t use the vendor dashboard.
- “Deletes” are archived so data isn’t lost right away.
- Vendor cart access is blocked (vendors don’t buy).

Demo story (short):
1) Customer logs in, shops, orders, rates up to 3 stars, and sees status updates in real time.
2) Vendor logs in, sees sales charts, adds a product, updates an order status, and messages the customer.
3) Admin approves a vendor, downloads an orders report, and views archived records.

If asked “what next?”:
- Show actual permit/ID files in admin view.
- Add more testing and monitoring.
- Add pagination for very large data sets.
